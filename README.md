# Ardoq_tasks
Task for interview with Ardoq


Task 1: 
Create a function that, given a list of integers, returns the highest product between three of those numbers.
For example, given the list [1, 10, 2, 6, 5, 3] the highest product would be 10 * 6 * 5 = 300

Task 2: 
Oslo city bikes has an open API showing real-time data on location and state of the bike stations.

Your task is to create a small application that utilizes this api to show the stations and the amount of available bikes and free spots a station currently has. 
Youâ€™re free to choose which language and libraries you use. How you show the stations and status is also up to you.
